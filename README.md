# Supervised_Learning_GD
Hi, this is my awsome project for gradient descent :smile:
the data that the project based on called ````data.csv```` you can check beside the notebook, if there's any question or bugs you can tell me using ````Issues```` section

# The DATA
A very simple data for traning

| X | Y |       
| - |:-:|
| 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 6 |
| 3 | 7 |
| 4 | 11|
| 5 | 4 | 

# The results:
## Before learning using gradient descent

## After 100 times of iteration and learning
